```markdown
C:\[TF2]\vpk\
C:\[ANY]\Titanfall2\
C:\[TF2]\Titanfall2\Titanfall2.exe

[ANY] Signifies that the directory to the folder/file can be variable  
[TF2] Means that the directory must be relative to the "Titanfall" root folder

### Building a development environment
To make developing easier, a python file is included to build a proper folder and file tree to make developing a breeze
